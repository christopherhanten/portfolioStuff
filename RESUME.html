<h3>EXPERIENCE</h3><br>

<b>Software Quality Analyst, AllClear ID</b><br>
<i>March 2015 – July 2017</i><br>
<div class = "mainText">
I fulfilled many roles in this position. Initially, my main object was manual testing of the customer support and consumer interfaces. I was heavily involved in documenting, not only the QA processes, but the testing plans as a whole. I wrote user stories and related test cases for documentation, and for the quality automation team to use as a framework for their work. I was the primary liaison between the QA team and the Engineering and Product teams. I was the engineering team Subject Matter Expert on the internal and external interfaces that were being build and improved upon. I conceptualized, wrote and ran regression tests, both on predetermined and ad hoc basis. I assisted in writing and upkeep of automated tests using Eclipse, Selenium, Java, and Jenkins. I was the keeper of test case versioning. I sat in on all Agile ceremonies as a representative of the Quality team. I was heavily involved in writing and delegating test cases in User Acceptance Testing. I acted as the primary point of contact for production deployments. I documented them, worked closely with the DevOps engineers, verified availability of all of the needed participants, narrated the actual deployment, QA’d the release and reported back to the entire organization on success or rollback. I was the one, on a couple of occasions, that called for the rollback, because in the production environment, I saw things that didn’t quite line up with the lower environments. In these cases, the Engineering group depended on my written analysis to the larger organization to concisely explain the situations that we ran into during deployment. I was involved in all aspects of the Software Development Life Cycle, and on many more in the PDLC. I was expected to self-manage and work with independence, with minimal oversight. I was essentially a scrum master and documentarian for the Quality Engineering Unit.

<b>Business Operations Manager, AllClear ID</b><br>
<i>April 2014 – December 2014</i><br>

<div class = "mainText">
This role revolved around managing our fulfillment team. Our operation was mailing letters, with heavy government regulation, to consumers affected by security breaches. I lead the team though letter construction, proofreading, and design. I interfaced with our third-party vendors - including visiting their facilities and worked with finance to verify proper billing status. I wrote job requirements, and interviewed candidates for positions to be filled on my team. I lead the continuous improvement process.

<br>
<b>Special Projects Manager, AllClear ID</b><br>
<i>March 2010 – April 2014</i><br>

<div class = "mainText">
This is a position that I essentially created for myself, by taking on all of the roles of the start-up customer service manager, with the exception of people management itself. I worked with the engineering team to create a brand-new process for sending out telephone-based alerts to our customer base. I ended up translating and recording tens of thousands of alerts. This role was primarily unsupervised, reporting directly to VP of Customer Services.<br><br>

In addition to alert creation, I acted as a liaison between Customer Support, Engineering, and Databases Administrators, to take bugs and nice-to-haves, noticed on the front-end, from the support team to the team that worked on the back-end.<br><br>

I worked directly with our CTO on many improvements and process reviews, to better our internal and external products. This allowed me to learn to see the projects from a high level, while also having the ability to drill down into the minutia.<br><br>

Finally, I worked heavily with Marketing to make sure that new initiates made sense from a user perspective. I trained the Support organization on new features, and upgrades to current ones. I advised Business Operations on what was coming down the pipeline, and verified that their processes fit into our current scheme.

<b>Customer Services Manager, AllClear ID</b><br>
<i>September 2007 – March 2010</i><br>

<div class = "mainText">
I began my journey as temporary employee in the AllClear ID call center. It was in the very early days of the company. I had immediately come from working at Starbucks, where delighting the customer was our number one job. I brought this mentality to the team I was one, and it was noticed by management. I was quickly promoted to Supervisor, and permanent employee. This position was so enjoyable. Since our company was in its infant stages, there were no rules or regulations assigned to the Customer Support arena. I wrote rules on attendance, behaviors, and vacation policies. I wrote all of our initial call scripting. I worked with others on the team to created a QA process, by which the call center representatives were measured, and aided in the set up and monitoring of telephone systems. In addition, I have a heady hand to the initial configuration of our Support Salesforce instance.
